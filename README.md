## Homework 4 README: 

Hey! This is my repository for homework 4! 

[Here](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw04-JasmineLib/blob/master/STAT545_hw04_JasmineLib.md) is the link to the md file.  
[Here](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw04-JasmineLib/blob/master/STAT545_hw04_JasmineLib.Rmd) is the link to the Rmd file.  


you might need to bring the additional csv file into your environment to run the code. If that is the case, you can access it [here](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw04-JasmineLib/blob/master/people_living_with_hiv_number_all_ages.csv). 

For this assignment, I chose the following prompts: 

#### Data Reshaping Prompts (and relationship to aggregation)  
- I chose Activity #2  
- I made a tibble with one row per year and columns for life expectancy for a few countries of interest.  
- I used this new tibble to plot the life expectancy of two countries against each other.  

#### Join Prompts (join, merge, look up)  
- I chose Activity #1    
- I created a dataframe containing data from the gapminder [website](https://www.gapminder.org/data/).   
- The data I was interested in looking at was the prevalence of HIV in various countries.   
- I explore various join functions, and how these affect the resulting dataframe that I obtain, as well as an exploration of HIV prevalence in the Americas. 


#### Resources used:
- the gapminder [website](https://www.gapminder.org/)
- [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)
- [website](http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/be-awesome-in-ggplot2-a-practical-guide-to-be-highly-effective-r-software-and-data-visualization) that helped me learn how to make nicer graphs, including using coordinate systems and geom_text (use command f in the guide to find this)
